 This sensor data were originally from Carlos Guestrin. It was subsequently used in \mbox{[}1\mbox{]} and later formatted for classification by Eamonn Keogh. The task is to distinguish between sensor {\itshape q8calib\+Humid} (a humidity measure) and sensor {\itshape q8calib\+Hum\+Temp} (a temperature measure). The data have dropouts. In the original data the dropouts have value 0. This means they are difficult to detect with normalized data.
