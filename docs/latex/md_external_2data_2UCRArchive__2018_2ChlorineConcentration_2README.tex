 This data set was introduced in a PhD thesis by Lei Li (see \mbox{[}1\mbox{]}. It was produced by EPANET, a software application that models the hydraulic and water quality behavior of water distribution piping systems. EPANET can track, in a given water network the water level and pressure in each tank, the water flow in the pipes and the concentration of a chemical species (chlorine in this case) throughout the network within a simulated duration.

Each time series is the measurements of the chlorine concentration level at 166 nodes (pipe junctions). The measurements were taken every 5 minutes over 15 days.
