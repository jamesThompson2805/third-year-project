By introducing base class templates, derived classes can inherit from multiple base classes arbitrarily. Using the dependency relationships between these classes, the topological sorting below linearizes complex inheritance structures into a single inheritance chain.

This approach retains the benefits of multiple inheritance while avoiding its drawbacks.

The only trade-\/off is a slight increase in compilation time when resolving highly complex inheritance dependencies.
