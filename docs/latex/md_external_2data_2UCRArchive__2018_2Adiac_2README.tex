 The Automatic Diatom Identification and Classification (ADIAC) project was a pilot study concerning automatic identification of diatoms (unicellular algae) on the basis of images. The data was donated by Andrei Jalba, a PhD student in the project, which was finished in the early 2000s. The outlines are extracted from thresholded images. Presumably the time series are generated as distance to a reference point (the centre being the obvious candidate). The data are very sinusoidal.
