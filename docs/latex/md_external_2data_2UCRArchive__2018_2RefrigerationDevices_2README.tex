 This problem was taken from data recorded as part of a government sponsored study called Powering the Nation. The intention was to collect behavioural data about how consumers use electricity within the home to help reduce the UK\textquotesingle{}s carbon footprint. The data contain readings from 251 households sampled in two-\/minute intervals over a month. Each series is of length 720 (24 hours of readings taken every 2 minutes). The three classes are Fridge/\+Freezer, Refrigerator and Upright Freezer.
