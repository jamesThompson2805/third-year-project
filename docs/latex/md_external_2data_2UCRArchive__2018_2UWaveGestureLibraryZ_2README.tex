 Data are accelerometer recording of eight simple gestures; it was first described in \mbox{[}1\mbox{]}.

{\itshape UWave\+Gesture\+LibraryX} is the x-\/axis reading only.

{\itshape UWave\+Gesture\+LibraryY} is the y-\/axis reading only.

{\itshape UWave\+Gesture\+LibraryZ} is the z-\/axis reading only.

{\itshape UWave\+Gesture\+Library\+All} is the concatenation of three axes readings.
